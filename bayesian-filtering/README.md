# Bayesian Filtering

Bayesian filtering test implementations in Python.

## Introduction

Two implementations of Bayesian tracking algorithms as part of an exercise for *Recursive estimation*. The implemented models include an *extended Kalman filter* as well as a *particle filter*. Bayesian filters recursively apply a *prediction* and a *filtering* step for inference of latent states from noisy observations, such as the input from a sensor of a robot.

## Installation

Install the dependencies using:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

That should let you run the notebook.
